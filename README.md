# ECE303-Guitar-Tuner

The basic description of this project is to attach a mechanism powered by a motor to a guitar peg, 
  pluck a guitar string, and have the mechanism automatically start turning the peg to tune the 
  string. Beforehand, the user would press a button to light up an LED on the board indicating which
  peg the user should put the mechanism on. 
This code is the code we used to program the Arduino.
